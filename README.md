# Code Quiz

## About the project

Building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions that runs locally in the browser and dynamically updates HTML and CSS by using JavaScript code with a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Usage

```
Code quiz runs locally on your browser, just open the index.html file from the Code-Quiz root folder.
```

To start playing just click on play button, the game will start with 40 seconds. You need to respond correctly the questions from the quiz.

If you have an error, the timer will decrease by 10 seconds.

If you want to see or clear highscores wait for the end of the game.
